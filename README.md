## 🧐 About
Wildlife monitoring is the methodology to understand where which animals are. This is crucial
to conduct wildlife management that ultimately prevents extinction of species and minimizes
conflicts between animals and humans. As of now, the field of wildlife monitoring does not have
the technologies of the 21st century. Within the scope of this paper, we are conceptualizing and
partially implementing a data management platform for rangers and biologists to make wildlife
monitoring more effective.
The main motivation is to create a user interface to display wolf howling data that was collected
through smart microphones that are placed in the forest. However, the requirement collection
have quickly shown that the users want a holistic data management platform with all monitoring
methods and all species, which lead to a pivot of our initial focus

## 🔬 Research Summary
We conducted a thorough requirement collection process including the creation of personas, scenarios use cases and finally the functional and non-functional requirements. Afterwards we created a desktop-based low fidelity prototype in Adobe XD. Next, a mobile and desktop-based high fidelity prototype in Figma. Finally we implemented the map section of platform in Angular.

## 🏛 Installation and Usage 
The backend is running on a server. Therefore it is only necessary to start the Angular-based frontend:

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
