## 🧐 About
Wildlife monitoring is the methodology to understand where which animals are. This is crucial
to conduct wildlife management that ultimately prevents extinction of species and minimizes
conflicts between animals and humans. As of now, the field of wildlife monitoring does not have
the technologies of the 21st century. Within the scope of this paper, we are conceptualizing and
partially implementing a data management platform for rangers and biologists to make wildlife
monitoring more effective.
The main motivation is to create a user interface to display wolf howling data that was collected
through smart microphones that are placed in the forest. However, the requirement collection
have quickly shown that the users want a holistic data management platform with all monitoring
methods and all species, which lead to a pivot of our initial focus
